ABSA Weather App

## Adroid Version 6.0 Marshmalow
I'm choosing this widely supported by 84.9% of devices and still compatable with the UI functionality I wwnt to use

## API `OpenWeatherMap` for Data
I chose this one because I had limited time and it was at the top, I presume there was no wrong answer there

## Retrofit#
> I used Retrofit as a dependecy for fetching the data from `OpenWeatherMap`
`Retrofit` is lightweight, open source and easy to use

## GeoLocation 
I used Android's `LOCATION_SERVICE` for locating the device to get the current city where the device is located

## Unit Testing
I didn't have much time for this so far, I could only start early this morning. I am doing the unit testing now

## Proguard
I didn't have much time for this so far, I could only start early this morning. I am configuring progaurd asap
